# Coauthor #

**Coauthor** is a tool for group collaboration, discussion, keeping track of
notes/results of meetings, etc.  Its primary goal is to ease multiauthor
collaboration on unsolved problems in theoretical computer science, so
e.g. you'll find LaTeX math support; hopefully it will have applications
in other fields too.

## Features so far ##

### Live updates ###
Live updates/redraw of everything, thanks to
[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).  No more hitting "reload".
If you're looking at a problem and someone posts/edits something,
you see it as quickly as they see their preview (roughly 1-second delay).

### Real-time editing ###
Real-time editing of messages in the style of EtherPad (Operational
Transforms), if people feel like editing together
(useful if e.g. working on a proof together).
When editing, you see near-instant updates from the other side(s).
Keep track of authorship by who is in edit mode at the time.
Also you get live previews with ~1-second delay, after the data has
round-tripped with the server.  (1 second delay is to reduce the crazy
number of "old versions" that will get saved -- server only pushes after
document has not changed for 1 second.)

### Writing formats ###
Three formats for writing messages (and easy to add additional formats).
All formats support LaTeX math (via `$...$`, `$$...$$`, `\(...\)`, `\[...\]`,
or `\begin{align/equation/eqnarray}...\end{align/equation/eqnarray}`)
via [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/), so math mode supports
[this list of supported functions](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/wiki/Function-Support-in-KaTeX).

* [Github-style Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
  (default), e.g., `*italic*`, `**bold**`, `~~strikethrough~~`,
  `# Heading`, `## Subheading`, \`code\`, `> Block quote`,
  <code>\`\`\`multiple lines of code\`\`\`</code>,
  links via `[text](url)`, images via `![caption](url)`,
  lists via `*` or `1.`, tables, etc.
* LaTeX, limited.  Beyond extensive math mode support (see below),
  the following features are supported in text mode; feel free to ask
  for more.  `%...`, `\def\macro{...}`, `\let\macro=\mac`, `\protect`,

  `\raisebox{amount}{text}`, `\par`,
  `\BY{...}`, `\YEAR{...}`,
  `\chapter`, `\section`, `\subsection`, `\subsubsection`, `\footnote`,
  `\includegraphics[width/height]{url}`, `\"`, `\'`, ```\` ```,
  `\^`, `\~`, `\=`, `\c`, `\v`, `\u`, `\H`, ``` `` ```, `''`,
  `\&`, `\$`, `\{`, `\}`, `~`, `--`, `---`, `{`, `}`, `\\`, `\item`,
  `\begin/\end` for environments `verbatim`, `enumerate`, `itemize`,
  `equation`, `eqnarray`, `align`,
  `problem`, `theorem`, `conjecture`, `lemma`, `corollary`, `fact`,
  `observation`, `proposition`, `claim`, `proof`.
* HTML, sanitized.  The following tags are allowed; feel free to ask for
  more.  `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`,
  `<blockquote>`, `<p>`, `<div>`, `<span>`,
  `<a href/name/target>`, `<ul>`, `<ol start>`, `<nl>`, `<li>`, `<b>`,
  `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<em>`, `<u>`, `<s>`, `<strike>`, `<del>`, `<code>`,
  `<hr>`, `<br>`, `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<caption>`,
  `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`, `<pre>`,
  `<img src/alt/width/height>`, `<video controls>`, `<source src>`
  attributes `title/style/class/aria-*`.

### CodeMirror editor ###
[CodeMirror editor](http://codemirror.net/) supports syntax highlighting,
block folding, bracket matching, line numbering, light and dark themes,
[spell checking](https://github.com/NextStepWebs/codemirror-spell-checker),
"regular" keybindings as well as Vim and Emacs keybindings
(if you've ever needed rectangular selection for e.g. ASCII art).

### Groups ###
Organization by **groups** (intended to correspond to groups of people who
meet).  Users can have permission to see and/or post within each
group, or at a global level (mainly intended for admins).
Admins can edit the permissions of other users via the "Users" button.

### Sorting ###
Sorting of threads within a group by title, creator, creation date,
last update, number of posts, or whether subscribed (by clicking on the
corresponding column, once for default sort order and again for
opposite sort order).  Intelligent handling of numbers while sorting,
e.g. "9." comes before "10.".

### Live feed ###
"Live Feed" to watch messages as they get changed/posted.  Useful for
projecting the latest activity onto a big screen while a group is gathered
and some are maybe editing.

### Catchup on recent posts ###
"Catchup on Recent Posts" to see all messages since a particular date/time
(including relative specifications like "1 week" or "12 hours").
Useful for progress reports since the last meeting.

### Threaded ###
Threaded message organization, with arbitrary tree structure (root
messages, replies with arbitrary depth).  You can focus on the subthread
rooted at any message (click on the arrow), or fold away the contents of a
subthread to focus on the rest.
(Currently the folds are not preserved across sessions / rerenders.)

### Dragging ###
Dragging messages to change the parentage/hierarchy, or move their
position within their parent.  You must drag *onto* the table of contents
on the right; you can drag *from* the table of contents, or from the
right-arrow of a message in the main view.
Dragging directly onto a message makes the dragged message the last child,
while dragging onto the slot before a message makes the dragged message the
immediately preceding sibling. Dialog confirms move.

### Tags ###
Attach an arbitrary set of strings to a message.  Find other
messages with the same tag by clicking on a tag.

### Search ###
Search for posts by a particular user by clicking on their username.
Search for your own posts in a group by clicking the "My Posts" button.

### Statistics ###
Statistics about user's and all posts within a group, by day, week
(with configurable week start), month, year, or hour within a day.

### Permanent URLs ###
Permanent URLs for all messages, groups, etc., for easy emailing etc.
(but other than group name, not revealing, so only those with permission
can open). Links to other messages via specical coauthor:xxx syntax.
Drag messages (via their arrow icon) into other messages to make such links.

### Files ###
Files (another type of message) can be attached to other messages, as
another type of reply.  You can click on the Attach button to select a file
to attach, or drag the file from the operating system onto the Attach
button.  Similarly, files can be modified by clicking the Replace File
button or dragging a file onto that button.
File messages can have title and body too; title defaults to the filename.
Image/video files (including PNG, JPEG, SVG, MP4) are displayed inline.
(In the future, they and other visual file types such as PDF will be
rendered by some kind of thumbnails.)

### Message deletion ###
Messages can start **Unpublished**, or after publication, **Deleted**;
in either state, the message is hidden from people who are not authors
(an *author* is someone who has edited the message), @-mentioned
(via `@username`), or superusers.
The default published state is initially true (so everyone sees the new
message and live updates immediately), but can vary by user (e.g., if they
are "shy" and only want to post finished thoughts).

### Public or private threads ###
Threads can be marked as allowing **public** replies only (the default, for
maximum collaboration), **private** replies only (useful for solved
problems/puzzles, to prevent accidentally spoiling of the fun), or
**public and private** replies (useful for feedback on lectures, for example,
which can have varying relevance to the entire group).  Replies to replies
inherit the public/private state of their parent.  Superusers can
see all the messages and change them between public and private.
Private messages can @-mention another user (via `@username` in the body)
to allow them to see and jointly edit the message.

### Email notifications ###
Email notifications for subscribed threads, clustering together all
updates since the last email, with a maximum lag a specified number of
hours or minutes (default 1 hour).
Each user can specify in Settings whether they are, by default, subscribed
to all threads or none, both globally and local to each group.
Either way, the default can be overridden in the group view using the
checkbox on the right (checked means "subscribed").
Users can choose in Settings whether to receive notifications
about their own edits.

### Time travel ###
Time travel You can drag through history and see past versions.
In general, there should be good, automatic history tracking of everything,
including a not-yet-visible reparenting feature.

### Superuser ###
Superuser operations (only for superusers):
* Import from LaTeX document with figures attached as a ZIP file
* Import from osqa's XML dump, including old edit history
* Superdelete (permanently destroying a message including its history)
* Setting the default sort for a group

## User Tips ##
* LaTeX mode supports LaTeX accents (like `\'e`), but other modes do not.  To
  easily type accented characters (e.g., on Windows where this is not easy), try
  [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fastaccent/gkadokkbkifbfpiljldcnnpkebpannhb/related?hl=en-GB)
  or
  [this Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/easyaccent/).
* Conversely, if you're on modern MacOS, holding down letter keys will bring
  up an accent tool instead of repeating the key.  If you'd rather repeat the
  key (e.g. for Vim mode),
  [follow these instructions](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/01/14/how-to-enable-key-repeats-on-your-mac/):
  `defaults write NSGlobalDomain ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false`
  then restart your web browser.

## Installation and Permissions ##
Here is how to get a local test server running:

### 1. Install meteor ###
`curl https://install.meteor.com | sh` on UNIX, or use the
[Windows installer](https://www.meteor.com/install)
  
### 2. Clone this repository ###
    git clone https://github.com/edemaine/coauthor.git
    
### 3. Run meteor ###
    cd coauthor
    meteor npm install
    meteor
    
### 4. Create a root account ###
Open the website [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
Create an account using the <kbd>Sign in/Join</kbd> button in the upper right corner.
Give your account permissions as follows:
  
    meteor mongo
    meteor:PRIMARY> db.users.update({username: 'edemaine'}, {$set: {'roles.*': ['read', 'post', 'edit', 'super', 'admin']}})
    WriteResult({ "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 })

Where `*` means all groups, so this user gets the following permissions globally:
* read: see the group and read the messages (otherwise invisible)
* post: create new messages, replies, etc. in the group
* edit: modify other people's messages
* super: somewhat dangerous "super" operations like history-destroying
  superdelete, history-creating import, and the ability to see other users'
  deleted messages
* admin: administer over other users, in particular setting permissions


## Automated deployment ##
To deploy to a public server, we recommend
[meteor-up](https://github.com/kadirahq/meteor-up).

1. Edit `.deploy/mup.js` to point to your SSH key (for accessing the server),
   your SSL certificate (for an https server), and your SMTP server in the
   [`MAIL_URL` environment variable](https://docs.meteor.com/api/email.html)
   (for sending email notifications &mdash; to run a local SMTP server,
   see below, and use e.g. `smtp://yourhostname.org:25/`).
   [`smtp://localhost:25/` may not work because of mup's use of docker.]
2. `mup setup` to install all necessary software on the server
3. `mup deploy` each time you want to deploy code to server
   (initially and after each `git pull`)

## SMTP server example ###
You need an SMTP server to send email notifications.
For example, install Postfix, modify the `/etc/postfix/main.cf` configuration as follows
(substituting your own hostname) and finally enable and start Postfix's service:

 * Set `myhostname = yourhostname.com`
 * Add `, $myhostname` to `mydestination`
 * Add ` 172.17.0.0/16` to `mynetworks`:

   `mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128 172.17.0.0/16`

If you want `coauthor@yourhostname.com` to receive email,
add an alias like `coauthor: edemaine@mit.edu` to `/etc/aliases`
and then run `sudo newaliases`.

## Performance monitoring ###
If you want to use [Kadira](https://kadira.io/) to monitor the performance,
errors, etc., the package is already installed; just add credentials to a
`server/kadira.js` file.
