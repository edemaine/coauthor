# Coauthor

**Coauthor** is a tool for group collaboration, discussion, keeping track of
notes/results of meetings, etc., in particular to enable
**[supercollaboration](https://supercollaboration.org/)**.
Coauthor's primary goal is to ease multiauthor collaboration on unsolved
problems in theoretical computer science, so e.g. you'll find LaTeX math
support, but it has proved useful in other fields too.

To see what's changed in Coauthor recently, check out the
[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Features

* **Live updates**/redraw of everything, thanks to
  [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).
  If you're looking at a problem and someone posts/edits something,
  you see it as quickly as they see their preview (roughly 1-second delay).
  You should never have to hit "reload" (except in case of a bug).

* **Real-time editing** of messages in the style of Google Docs/EtherPad
  (Operational Transforms), if people feel like editing together
  (useful if e.g. working on a proof together).
  * When editing, you see near-instant updates from the other side(s).
  * Keeps track of coauthorship by who is in edit mode at the time.
  * Can also manually add coauthors (e.g. when one person scribes the work
    of many) or remove coauthors (e.g. accidents or minor edits)
  * Live previews of formatted message with ~1-second delay, after the data has
    round-tripped with the server.  (The delay is to reduce the crazy
    number of "old versions" that get saved in the history: the server only
    pushes after the document has not changed for 1 second.)

* Three **formats** for writing messages (and easy to add additional formats).
  All formats support LaTeX math (via `$...$`, `$$...$$`, `\(...\)`, `\[...\]`,
  or `\begin{align/alignat/equation/eqnarray/gather/CD}...\end{align/alignat/equation/eqnarray/gather/CD}`)
  via [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), so math mode supports
  [this list of supported functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html)
  (see also [this support table](https://katex.org/docs/support_table.html)).
  Macros defined with `\gdef` can be used throughout one message.

  * [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
    (default), e.g., `*italic*`, `**bold**`, `~~strikethrough~~`,
    `# Heading`, `## Subheading`, `` `code` ``, `> Block quote`,
    ` ```multiple lines of code``` `
    (including [language-based highlighting](https://highlightjs.org/)
     if you start with ` ```language `),
    links via `[text](url)`, images via `![caption](url)`,
    lists via `*` or `1.`, to-do lists via `* [ ]` and `* [x]`,
    [tables](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables), etc.
    Also supports all LaTeX commands listed below that start with a letter
    (notably, not accents) and math mode, and all HTML commands listed below.

    with optional argument for `<summary>`),
    `proof+`, `theorem+`, etc. (like `proof, `theorem`, etc.
    wrapped in `details` environment).
  [HTML `<details>`/`<summary>` tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details):
    Also supports all HTML commands listed below.
  * HTML, sanitized.  The following tags are allowed; feel free to ask for

    `<img src/alt/width/height>`, `<video controls>`, `<source src>`;
    attributes `title`, `style`, `class` (limited), `aria-*`.
    Also supports LaTeX math mode.

* Light and dark themes available under Settings.

* [CodeMirror editor](http://codemirror.net/) supports syntax highlighting,
  block folding, bracket matching, line numbering, light and dark themes,
  [spell checking](https://github.com/edemaine/codemirror-spell-checker),
  "regular" keybindings as well as Vim and Emacs keybindings
  (especially useful for rectangular selection for e.g. ASCII art),
  multiple cursors for simultaneous editing (ctrl-click).

  * **Copy/paste** produces text by default.  Special handling of Coauthor
    URLs produces `coauthor:...` links or embeds images.  Special handling of
    user URLs produces @mentions.  To paste rich text, you can toggle HTML
    paste mode via Ctrl-Shift-H.
  * @mentioning has automatic completion of all users in group. You can type
    any substring of the real name or username (but skipping spaces, like
    GitHub), and select by pressing enter, or ignore by pressing space.

* Messages are organized by **groups** (intended to correspond to groups of
  people who meet), so it's easy to share material with everyone in the group.
  But it's also possible to share part of a group (only certain threads)
  with specific users, for visitors or paper merges etc.

* **Sorting** of threads within a group by title, creator, creation date,
  last update, number of posts, number of positive emoji responses, or whether
  subscribed (by clicking on the corresponding column, once for default sort
  order and again for opposite sort order).  Intelligent handling of numbers
  while sorting, e.g. "9." comes before "10.".  Deleted messages always sort
  to the very bottom; minimized messages always sort near the bottom;
  pinned messages always sort near the top; and
  unpublished messages always sort near the very top.

* "**Live Feed**" to watch messages as they get changed/posted.  Useful for
  projecting the latest activity onto a big screen while a group is gathered
  and some are maybe editing.

* "**Catchup on Recent Posts**" to see all messages since a particular date/time
  (including relative specifications like "1 week" or "12 hours").
  Useful for progress reports since the last meeting.

* **Threaded** message organization, with arbitrary tree structure (root
  messages, replies with arbitrary depth).  You can **focus** on the subthread
  rooted at any message (click on the arrow), or **fold** away the contents of
  a subthread to focus on the rest (click on the minus sign).
  Folding with the minus/plus sign is a local and temporary change (resets when
  reloading the page), while **minimizing** the message makes it start out
  folded for all users (e.g., when a discussion/question resolves and is
  no longer important, but you want to preserve it for future reference).

* **Move** (reparent) messages by selecting Action / Move, or by dragging
  messages around in the table of contents on the right.
  (You can also start a drag in the main view from the right-arrow
  of a message, but the drag must end at the table of contents.)
  Dragging directly onto a message makes the dragged message the last child,
  while dragging onto the slot before a message makes the dragged message the
  immediately preceding sibling.  Dialog confirms move, and allows you to type
  another message title/creator/ID, or the name of a group if you want to
  make the message into a new thread's root message.

* **Tags**: attach an arbitrary set of strings to a message.  Find other
  messages with the same tag by clicking on a tag.

* **Emoji** for super-short responses that show appreciation but don't cause
  email notifications or take up much space.  (Like GitHub and Slack.)
  Hover over an emoji to see a list of people who added the emoji; click to
  toggle your own status.  Emoji are positive (purple) or negative (red).
  Positive emoji on root messages are counted on the group page, enabling
  a simple voting system for e.g. which problems to work on.

* **Search** across the current group, thread, or across all groups,
  for posts by keywords using the search bar at the top.
  * Search for a word as a whole `word` (default behavior), or specify
    asterisks to search for partial word matches: `prefix*`, `*suffix`,
    `*substring*`, or `prefix*suffix`.
  * Lower-case letters are case insensitive,
    while upper-case letters are case sensitive.
  * Restrict search to title or body via `title:...` or `body:...`
    (default is to search both).
  * Negative match with minus sign
    (e.g., `-word` excludes documents with whole `word`).
  * Search for a regular expression via `regex:...`.
  * Use quotes (`'...'` or `"..."`) to search for phrases or `regex:"..."`
    to search for regular expressions with spaces in them; normally,
    spaces act as an AND query.
  * Connect words/phrases with `|` to get an OR query instead.
  * Use parentheses to mix AND and OR arbitrarily, e.g. `always (this | that)`.
  * `by:username` searches for messages coauthored by a specified username
    (which can include `*`s or use regular expressions via `regex:`);
    `by:me` is shorthand for searching for your own username.
  * `tag:...` does an exact match for a specified tag; it can be negated.
  * `emoji:heart`, `emoji:thumbs-up`, `emoji:thumbs*`, `emoji:*` etc. search
    for messages with (certain) emoji symbol responses;
    `emoji:@username` searches for messages with emoji response by
    a specific user (`emoji:@me` finds your own emoji responses);
    or you can combine the two with e.g. `emoji:thumbs*@username`.
  * `root:id` matches messages in thread with specified root message ID.
  * `is:root` matches root messages (tops of threads).
  * `is:file` matches file messages (made via Attach).
  * `is:deleted`, `is:published`, `is:private`, `is:minimized`, `is:pinned`,
    `is:protected` match various states of messages.
  * `is:empty` matches empty messages (no title, body, or file).
  * `not:...` or `isnt:...` are negated forms of the above `is:...` operators,
    equivalent to `-is:...`.

* **User search**:
  find posts by a particular user by clicking on their username.
  Search for your own posts in a group by clicking the "My Posts" button.

* **Statistics** about user's and all posts within a group, by day, week
  (with configurable week start), month, year, or hour within a day.
  Your own statistics are available via the Statistics button on the group
  page, while other users' stats are available from their user page.

* **Permanent URLs** for all messages, groups, etc., for easy emailing etc.
  (but other than group name, not revealing, so only those with permission
  can open).  Links to other messages via specical `coauthor:xxx` syntax.
  Drag messages (via their arrow icon) into other messages to make such links.

* **Files** (another type of message) can be attached to other messages, as
  another type of reply.  You can click on the Attach button to select a file
  to attach, or drag the file from the operating system onto the Attach
  button.  Similarly, files can be modified by clicking the Replace File
  button or dragging a file onto that button.
  File messages can have title and body too; title defaults to the filename.
  Image/video files (including PNG, JPEG, SVG, MP4) are displayed inline.
  Images automatically detect EXIF orientation, and can be further rotated by
  multiples of 90 degrees in edit mode.
  PDF files are rendered using [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/),
  only when visible on screen, and displayed inline with page-turning buttons.

* Messages can start/be marked **Unpublished** (not yet finished) or
  **Deleted** (mistake / no longer useful).
  In either state, the message is hidden from people who are not coauthors
  (as listed in the "by" line and editable at the bottom of the Edit view)
  or superusers who click "Become Superuser".
  The default published state is initially true (so everyone sees the new
  message and live updates immediately), but can vary by user (e.g., if they
  are "shy" and only want to post finished thoughts).

* Threads can be marked as allowing **public** replies only (the default, for
  maximum collaboration), **private** replies only (useful for solved
  problems/puzzles, to prevent accidentally spoiling the fun), or
  **public and private** replies (useful for feedback on lectures, for example,
  which can have varying relevance to the entire group).
  * Private messages have an **access list** of users who can see the message
    beyond the coauthors, initially set to include the access list and all
    coauthors of the parent message being replied to ("Reply All" behavior for
    back-and-forth private conversation).
    Unlike coauthors, access users can only see the message
    when it is published and not deleted.
    You can add or remove users from the access list, but note that permissions
    are not synchronized between parent and children, so if you change a
    parent's permissions you might also want to change the children's.
  * Replies to replies inherit the public/private state of their parent.
  * Superusers can see all the messages and change them between public and
    private.
  * Superusers can also mark messages as **protected**, meaning they can be
    edited only by coauthors and superusers.  This is useful to prevent someone
    from accidentally becoming a coauthor on the root message of a
    private-replies thread, thereby gaining access to all subsequent replies.
    Protected messages can still be seen normally and gain emoji responses.

* **Email notifications** for subscribed threads, clustering together all
  updates since the last email, with a maximum lag of a specified number of
  hours or minutes (default 1 hour).
  Each user can specify in Settings whether they are, by default, subscribed
  to all threads or none, both globally and local to each group.
  Either way, the default can be overridden in the group view using the
  checkbox on the right (checked means "subscribed").
  Users can choose in Settings whether to receive notifications
  about their own edits, and whether to receive separate email messages for
  each group (e.g. for email folder separation) or bundle them altogether.

* **Time travel**: You can drag through history and see past versions.
  Versions of messages where the user explicitly clicked "Stop Editing"
  are marked as "finished" versions, and only those are shown by default.
  But if you need to see more intermediate versions,
  you can click "Show All Versions".
  In general, Coauthor aims to automatically track all history
  in case it's useful later.

* **Download ZIP**: You can archive an entire group's contents into a ZIP file
  of raw HTML/CSS and attached files which requires no JavaScript to run.
  This future-proofs your content against software rot, making it suitable for
  NSF's Data Archiving Policy.  It is also useful for offline viewing of
  content, e.g., while traveling.

* **Permissions** can be specified for each user at the group level
  (typical case --- user can access the entire group of messages),
  at the thread level (user can access only certain threads within group),
  or at the global level: just click "Users" in the appropriate view.
  Levels of access:

     * read: see the group and read the messages (otherwise invisible)
     * post: create new messages, replies, etc. in the group
     * edit: modify other people's messages
     * super: somewhat dangerous "super" operations like history-destroying
       superdelete, history-creating import, and the ability to see other users'
       deleted messages
     * admin: administer over other users, in particular setting permissions

  Anonymous access means that everyone, even not-logged-in users, can see the
  messages and group.  This is generally not recommended as it opens Coauthor
  to spam, so it requires global admin privileges to enable.

* **Superuser operations** (only for superusers):
  * Import from LaTeX document with figures attached as a ZIP file
  * Import from osqa's XML dump, including old edit history
  * Superdelete (permanently destroying a message including its history)
  * Setting the default sort for a group
  * Setting message threads as allowing public and/or private messages

## User Tips

* On Android, the
  [Chrome browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&hl=en)
  with [SwiftKey keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey)
  seems to work best for editing messages in Coauthor.
  (Firefox and Gboard have cursor positioning issues.)
* LaTeX mode supports LaTeX accents (like `\'e`), but other modes do not.
  To easily type Unicode accented characters,
  use [WinCompose](https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose) on Windows,
  [set up a compose key on Linux](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ComposeKey),
  or
  [press and hold keys on MacOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/enter-characters-with-accent-marks-on-mac-mh27474/mac).
* Conversely, if you're on modern MacOS, holding down letter keys will bring
  up an accent tool instead of repeating the key.  If you'd rather repeat the
  key (e.g. for Vim mode),
  [follow these instructions](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/01/14/how-to-enable-key-repeats-on-your-mac/):
  `defaults write NSGlobalDomain ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false`
  then restart your web browser.
* [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) is incompatible with the Vim editor mode
  (specifically, both capture the Escape key), so be sure to disable Vimium if
  you want to use Vim keybindings in the message editor.
