PHASE 1 = announce to 6.890, encourage testing
PHASE 2 = experiment with solving some problems on coauthor
PHASE 3 = switch entirely over to coauthor

FEATURES

* Should messages have types?
  (e.g. problem, discussion, question, idea, paper, figure...)

* Image embedding, and conversion of 6890 URLs into image blobs

* Reparenting (moving messages around): within same root, across roots?

* Import users (with email addresses, but probably no passwords)
  when importing messages [PHASE 3]

* Import deleted flags [PHASE 3]

* Import specific group (6.851 vs. 6.890) [PHASE 3]

* Related: Moving messages between groups

* Tags + import [PHASE 3]

* Email notifications [PHASE 2]

* SSL (then force-ssl package).  Perhaps using Meteor Up:
  https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up#ssl-support

* Dropbox plugin

* MIT certificates

* \label/\ref

* Folding

* Search

* Thumbnail generation, especially for PDF, following
  https://github.com/vsivsi/meteor-file-job-sample-app/blob/master/sample.coffee

* Live feed of all updates (since a particular date) [PHASE 3]
  (also useful for back-extracting new stuff into old osqa system)

PERFORMANCE

* can we decouple child submessages from parent, so they don't all re-render
  when just the parent changes?

BUGS

* Editor isn't working on Android: each key erases the previous. :-(

* role changes aren't logged anywhere, but should be

* OT issues: Need to require authentication.
  Also, should use in-memory instead of database, OR, when starting server and
  setting all editing to [], should also delete the OT documents.

* Disabled New Problem button doesn't show tooltip
